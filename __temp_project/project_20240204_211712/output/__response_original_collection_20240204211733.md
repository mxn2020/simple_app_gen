  "file_instruction": "'calculator.py' is the core logic file for performing calculations in the calculator application. You can use the defined functions such as add, subtract, multiply, and divide to perform basic arithmetic operations. Additional functions for advanced operations, memory functions, history logging, and error handling are also available in this file. Proper input validation should be done to ensure accurate calculation results."
